# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via a GitHub
issue before making a change.

Please note we follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).
Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that you've provided the reasoning behind the change in the description of your PR.
2. Await code review and approval by the repository reviewers.
3. If there are things that need to be changed, you'll be informed of them.
4. Once everything looks good, it'll be merged.
5. If the change is deemed undesirable, the PR will be closed without merging.

## Server Icon Submissions

Server icons can be as creative as you want! However, there are some baselines that should be followed:

1. The server icon should contain the Ferris from the cover of the Rust book. The bases are located
in the `assets/server-icons/bases/` folder.
2. The file name should follow the pattern `server_icon_<brief description>.<ext>`.

That way people can still recognize the server icon at a glance, which is important for a
lot of people.

Additionally, the server icon is supposed to represent either silly ideas or support for a cause. Here are a few non-exhaustive examples of things that are allowed and disallowed:

Allowed:

1. References to LGBTQ+ causes
2. References to BLM causes
3. Inside jokes of the Discord server
4. Ferris holding the logo of other programming languages

Disallowed:

1. References to Nazism/pedophilia/zoophilia (or any cause that is generally not socially accepted)
2. Ferris holding anything that implies a programming language is bad
(for example, Ferris holding a flag that says `Rust > C++`, or Ferris holding the PHP logo with a ðŸš« on top of it)
3. References to NSFW topics

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by opening a modmail in the [repository's associated Discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
